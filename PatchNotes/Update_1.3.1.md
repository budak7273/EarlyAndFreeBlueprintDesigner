## Changed Stuff

- All blueprint designers now cost nothing to place instead 1 Leaves item
  - [The base-game bug was fixed](https://www.answeroverflow.com/m/1290190197501460521).

## Extensibility

If you are a mod developer and you have created some mods that add more Blueprint Designers,
you can easily make this mod detect them by adding the
`EarlyAndFreeBlueprintDesigner.MakeThisRecipeFree` Content Tag to your designer's recipe
and `EarlyAndFreeBlueprintDesigner.GiveThisSchematic` to your designer's unlocking schematic.
Learn about Content Tags in the [modding documentation](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/Development/ModLoader/ContentTagRegistry.html).
