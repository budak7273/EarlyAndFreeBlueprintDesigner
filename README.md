**Multiplayer compatible!**

_This mod currently maintained by Robb_

## Overview

> If you, like me, got a bit disappointed when you heard that blueprints wouldn't be available until Tier 4 in game,
> this is for you!
> Now available from Day 0 (helping with placing a lot of foundations / walls / smelters + construction setup, etc).
> I decided to make this free since I see the blueprints as a tool rather than as a "machine."

After installing the mod, the 3 vanilla Blueprint Designers and Blueprints tab of the build gun will be automatically unlocked for you, and the Blueprint Designer will cost ~~nothing~~ (currently 1 Leaf to work around a vanilla bug) to place. Using a Blueprint to build something still costs its build cost, of course.

If you uninstall the mod, you will still have access to the Designer building recipe (albeit changed back to its base-game cost) and you will retain access to Blueprint usage in the Build Gun.

## Extensibility

I may extend this mod to already support some popular blueprint designer mods out of the box in the future.

If you are a mod developer and you have created some mods that add more Blueprint Designers,
you can easily make this mod detect them by adding the
`EarlyAndFreeBlueprintDesigner.MakeThisRecipeFree` Content Tag to your designer's recipe
and `EarlyAndFreeBlueprintDesigner.GiveThisSchematic` to your designer's unlocking schematic.
Learn about Content Tags in the [modding documentation](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/Development/ModLoader/ContentTagRegistry.html).
